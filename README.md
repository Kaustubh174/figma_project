# Surf Report application using Figma #
Me and my team created a demo of Surf Report application in our group work in Audencia. Here is the demo

<br> We found many issues in the other surf report applications and decided to create our own improvised version.
<br>This application we created gives very good understanding of the surfing report even for the beginners
<br>This solve a big issues as the other application provided complex report which only experts could understand.
